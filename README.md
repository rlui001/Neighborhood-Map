# Neighborhood-Map-Project
A single-page application featuring a map of my neighborhood that features many hot locations worth visiting. 

I have decided to use my school campus as the area of interest, with markers at locations that are more difficult to reach without a map, as well as popular spots for students.


- Found Yelp API v3 unable to be used with javascript (could not retrieve access token).
- Yelp API v2 also gave GET errors, so I ended up using FourSquare's API to get location street/city.


To run:
- Download and extract files into any directory
- Open index.html
