# Neighborhood-Map-Project
A single-page application featuring a map of my neighborhood that features many hot locations worth visiting. 

I have decided to use my school campus as the area of interest, with markers at locations that are more difficult to reach without a map, as well as popular spots for students.


THINGS TO DO:
- Clicking on list --> action to the marker

- Add markers
	- Add animation when clicked, etc.

- Add info box when marker/list item is clicked
	- use Yelp for the data?
